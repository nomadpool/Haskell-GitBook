# The Investment Club

You have recently joined a club that invests in Cardano. The club has assigned you the tasks of keeping track of everyone's share and properly distributing staking rewards to each person. You don't have to worry about actually executing trades; you only need to do the bookkeeping. Use what you have learned in this guide to write a program that does this. It should have the following features:

1. Be able to add new members
2. Be able to add required deposits for each member
3. Be able to automatically distribute the rewards to each member based on what percentage of stake they have in the club
4. Be able to withdraw funds for a member
5. Be able to query the records for things like: total ADA, Reward History, Deposit History, and Withdrawal History. They should be displayed as tables.
6. You can also add graphing to see the club's portfolio (denominated in ADA) over time
7. Your database should be stored as a compressed JSON file and your program should be able to export member information to Csv files.

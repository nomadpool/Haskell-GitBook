# Chapter Exercises

### Modernizing the Store

For this exercise, you are going to take your store program from the Chapter 2 exercises and add the following features:

1. Store the inventory as a JSON file.
2. Add a feature for adding inventory to the catalog when a shipment comes in.
3. Record the transaction history as a Csv file.
4. If you have multiple of the same books/video games, keep track of this in another Csv file and update it when purchases are made.
5. Generate a monthly news letter as a plain text file. It should tell people of the latest books and video games available. Try to automate the creation of the news letter based on the inventory.

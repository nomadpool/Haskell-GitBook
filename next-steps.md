# Next Steps

Hopefully this guide got you writing your very own Haskell programs. If it did, then this guide would have accomplished the goal it was designed for. However there is still plenty to learn on your Haskell journey. Below is a short list of what we believe to be good resources to check out next. They are ranked in order of how useful they were for us. We will add to these lists as we continue finding resources on our own journey.

#### Free Resources

1. Learn You a Haskell for Great Good book (link [here](http://learnyouahaskell.com))
2. Online Functional Programming Course for the University of Helsinki (link [here](https://haskell.mooc.fi))
3. Philipp Hagenlocher's Youtube Channel (link [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3xdLFFsqG701QAyGJIPT1g))

#### Paid Resources

1. The Haskell Book (link [here](https://haskellbook.com))

As you are learning, don't be afraid to re-write the same program a few dozen times. In fact, it may be one of the best ways to learn new concepts since you can focus on just the new concepts. Good luck fellow Haskeller!

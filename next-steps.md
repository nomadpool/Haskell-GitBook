# Next Steps

Hopefully this guide got you writing your very own Haskell programs. However there is still plenty to learn on your Haskell journey. Below is a short list of what we believe to be good resources to check out next.

#### Free Resources

1. Online Functional Programming Course for the University of Helsinki (link [here](https://haskell.mooc.fi))
2. Learn You a Haskell for Great Good book (link [here](http://learnyouahaskell.com))
3. Philip Hagenlocher's Youtube Channel (link [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3xdLFFsqG701QAyGJIPT1g))

#### Paid Resources

1. The Haskell Book (link [here](https://haskellbook.com))

As you are learning, don't be afraid to re-write the same program a few dozen times. In fact, it may be one of the best ways to learn new concepts. Good luck fellow Haskeller!
